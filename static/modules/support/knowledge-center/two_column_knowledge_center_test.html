							<div class="knowledge-center__question-answer">
								There are several proactive measures that you can employ to prevent liquidation and
								manage risk:<br/>
								<div class="rtf">
									<ul>
										<li>Actively monitor the status of your open positions.</li>
										<li>Specify a stop-loss order for each open trade to limit downside risk. You
											can specify the stop-loss rate at the time you issue a trade, or add a
											stop-loss order at any time for any open trade. You can also change your
											stop-loss orders at any time to take current market prices or other
											conditions into account. The use of stop loss orders may not necessarily
											limit your losses.
										</li>
										<li>Keep your account funded in excess of your required margin. These extra
											funds act as a cushion, protecting you if the market moves against you. If
											you are in danger of breaching your margin limits, either incrementally
											reduce the size of your position or add funds to your account as soon as
											possible.
										</li>
										<li>Employ lower leverage. You may request a leverage change at any time.</li>

								If at any point, the equity available drops below 100% of the margin required you will
