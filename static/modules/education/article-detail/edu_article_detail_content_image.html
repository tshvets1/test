				<h3>So Everyone's Talking About Trading Gold - What Is It All About?</h3>

				<p>
					Human beings have long valued and treasured gold for its inherent luster and malleability. In fact,
					gold has
					been used in human
					commerce since the societies of the ancient Middle East over 2,500 years ago, making it the oldest
					form of
					money still recognized today .
					Gold’s long track record as a store of value despite wars, natural disasters, and the rise and fall
					of great
					empires means that it is generally
					seen as the ultimate “safe haven” asset.
					While gold has generally held its value for centuries, traders’ interest has waxed and waned in
					recent
					years. From the early 1980s until the
					early 2000s, there was little interest in trading safe-haven gold amidst the strong, stable economic
					growth
					and high-fling stock markets.
					As a result, gold generally consolidated between $300/oz and $500/oz for twenty years, from
					1982-2002.
					Interest in gold grew slowly through the 2000s before exploding with the onset of the Great
					Financial Crisis
					in 2008. Gold prices rose in
					sympathy, hitting an all-time high above $1900 in late 2011. In this guide, we will discuss the
					major forces
					that drive gold prices, along with
					some ideas for trading strategies and some of the most common methods for trading gold.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Factors That Influence Its Price
				</h3>

				<p>
					Gold is one of the most diffiult fiancial assets to value. Gold is similar to a currency like the
					U.S.
					dollar or the euro because it is durable,
					portable, uniform across the world, and widely accepted; however, unlike these more commonly traded
					currencies, gold is not supported
					by an underlying economy of workers, companies, and infrastructure. In other ways, gold is more
					similar to a
					commodity like oil or corn
					because it comes from the ground and has standardized physical characteristics. Unlike other
					commodities,
					though, the price of gold
					often flctuates independently of its industrial supply and demand. In fact, only about 10% of the
					world’s
					gold is used in industry: primarily
					in electronics, due to its conductivity and anti-corrosive properties. The rest of the world’s gold
					is
					either made into jewelry or held for
					investment purposes.
				</p>

				<p>
					Because of this dynamic, the emotions and behaviors of traders tend to drive major trends
					in the yellow metal. With gold more than any other asset, traders seem to be
					polarized between diehard “gold bugs” who believe that gold should be
					worth $10,000 an ounce because central banks around the world
					are debasing their currencies and bearish traders who assert
					that gold is a “barbarous relic” of the past that should be worth
					closer to $100. As the chart above shows, the gold bugs’ view
					developed into a bit of a mania back in the mid- and late-
					2000s, though the more recent drop suggests gold may
					be losing some of its previous luster.
				</p>

				<p>
					Historically, one of the most reliable determinants of
					gold’s price has been the level of real interest rates,
					or the interest rate less infltion. If you think about
					it, this relationship is straightforward. When real
					interest rates are low, investment alternatives like
					cash and bonds tend to provide a low or negative
					return, pushing investors to seek alternative ways to
					protect the value of their wealth. On the other hand,
					when real interest rates are high, strong returns are
					possible in cash and bonds and the appeal of holding
					a yellow metal with few industrial uses diminishes. One
					easy way to see a proxy for real interest rates in the United
					States, the world’s largest economy, is to look at the yield on
					Treasury Infltion Protected Securities (TIPS).
				</p>

				<h3>A Sample Long-Term Strategy - Watch The Level Of Real Interest Rates</h3>

				<p>
					Longer-term position traders and investors can focus more on the fundamentals driving gold’s price,
					such as
					the level of real interest
					rates. The chart below shows the relationship between gold prices and the yield on TIPS, a proxy for
					real
					interest rates in the United
					States. The inverse correlation is obvious, but it looks like gold’s rally accelerated as real
					yields
					dropped below 1% in early 2009. Not
					surprisingly, a longer-term look at the relationship would reveal that gold prices generally fell in
					the
					late 1990s, which were characterized
					by real yields above the 1% threshold.
				</p>

				<h3>
					Gold Price vs Tips Yield Since 2008
				</h3>

				<p>
					Therefore, longer-term traders may want to consider buy opportunities if real yields are below 1%, a
					level
					which has historically been
					supportive of gold prices. Conversely, if real yields rise above 2%, investors may want to focus
					more on
					sell trades. Of course, this
					relationship between real yields and gold prices plays out over longer-term timeframes, so
					shorter-term gold
					traders can generally
					ignore the level of interest rates.
				</p>

				<p>
					The ability to use a filter based on real interest rates is one of the unique features that traders
					can use
					to gain an edge when trading gold,
					but the trading strategies and opportunities in trading the world’s oldest “currency” are truly
					limitless.
