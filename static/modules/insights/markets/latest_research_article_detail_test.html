						<p>The USD/CAD has had a torrid time of late. In a nutshell, the Canadian dollar (which is a
							commodity currency) has strengthened on the back of higher oil prices and also some
							stronger-than-expected inflation figures from Canada, while at the same time, the US dollar
							has
							weakened on some mixed-bag US data and after Janet Yellen recently dismissed fears about a
							pickup in US inflation. As a result of the weaker USD and stronger CAD, the USD/CAD has
							fallen
							sharply. Today, that trend continued for a while although rates have since turned flat after
							the
							release of some good US pending home sales number (it was up 6.1% month-over-month in May
							vs.
							1.4% expected) and a disappointing GDP figure from Canada (this showed a meagre 0.1% growth
							in
							April, missing the expected reading of 0.2%). Nevertheless, the upcoming US data releases
							this
							week, combined with the technicals – which we will discuss shortly – means there’s a
							possibility
							the USD/CAD could stage a more profound recovery later this week.</p>

						<h2>Technical view</h2>

						<p>Following the recent sell-off, the USD/CAD has entered the upper end of a key technical area,
							namely 1.0560 to 1.0660. As can be seen from the weekly chart, 1.0660 was previously a major
							resistance level, so there’s a good chance it could now turn into support. In addition,
							there
							are a couple of Fibonacci levels fast approaching: the first one is the 61.8% retracement
							level
							of the upswing from September, while the 38.2% retracement level of the move up from the
							2011
							low comes in at 1.0560. What’s more, we have a medium-turn bullish trend line also cutting
							through this 1.0560/1.0660 range, while the daily RSI, currently below 25, is looking
							extremely
							oversold. Thus for all of these reasons, there is the possibility we may see some sort of a
							bounce here, potentially towards the old support level of 1.0820 in the short-term.</p>

						<p>Having said that, there is also the possibility that the currency pair may simply continue in
							its
							recent downward trend, especially if it is weighed down by the fundamentals with so much US
							data
							coming up this week. Among the other factors, one technical flagging sign is displayed on
							the
							weekly RSI. This has broken its trend line in advance of price, which is a bearish
							development
							as it suggests the USD/CAD my follow suit and breaks its own trend. The confirmation of the
							bear
							trend continuation would be a daily close below the lower end of the aforementioned range
							i.e.
							1.0560.</p>
